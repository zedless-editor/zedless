## Unmaintained scripts from upstream Zed

The primary developer of Zedless packages it using Nix, and is not keeping any scripts in this folder up-to-date.
As of November 2025, some scripts in this folder are known to be broken, in ways that may be very subtle.

If you need to use a script from this folder, please create a PR that moves it to a top-level `script` folder.
That PR will give Zedless developers the opportunity to help you avoid problems, and if someone is willing to maintain the script, your PR can be merged
and the script will be considered safe to use for everyone else too.

> [!WARNING]
> Please do not use any script in this folder blindly. There's no telling what subtle horrors may result in you (or someone you were trying to help) banging their head against a wall in the future.
